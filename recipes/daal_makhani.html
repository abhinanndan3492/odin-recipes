    <h2>Description:-</h2>
    <p>Dal Makhani is a popular North Indian dish made with whole black lentils (urad), red kidney beans (rajma), butter and cream. It is usually served with naan.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cup soaked overnight red kidney beans</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
        <li>1 large chopped onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cream</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>water as required</li>
        <li>2 inch chopped ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon refined oil</li>
        <li>2 medium sliced & slit green chilli</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garam masala powder
        </li>
        <li>1/2 cup soaked overnight urad dal</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic paste
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to make Dal Makhani</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Soak urad, rajma overnight & pressure cook the next day.
        </li>
        <p>To prepare this popular dish, soak sabut urad and rajma overnight in three cups of water. Drain it and pressure cook in 6 cups of water with salt as per taste. This makes the rajma and dal soft.</p>
        <li> Fry the onions, green chillies & tomato puree.</li>
        <p>Take a kadhai on medium flame, then heat the oil and add the cumin seeds. Once the cumin seeds crackle, you can add half the ginger-garlic paste and stir for some time. Then add some onions, chopped green chillies and tomato puree. Fry until the mix turns golden. If you are someone who loves the authentic style of Dal Makhani, then we suggest you to use ghee instead of oil.</p>
        <li> Add the rajma & dal.</li>
        <p>Once the bhuna masala is ready you can add the pressure cooked Rajma and dal, and bring to a boil. If you want your Dal Makhani to be smooth, you can grind the masala first and then add the dal and Rajma.</p>
        <li> Add the garam masala & garnish with fresh cream & coriander leaves</li>
        <p>Then add garam masala and salt as per your taste. Stir well and bring to boil, if you think that the dal is too thick, you can add some water. Then add some fresh cream to this recipe and stir well. This will make your Dal Makhani creamy and delicious. Garnish this recipe with fresh cream and freshly chopped coriander leaves.</p>
    </ol>

    <h2><strong>Tips:</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You can serve this creamy dal makhni with naan, jeera rice and tandoori butter roti.
        </li>
        <li>Do not forget to add a dollop of butter or ghee in the bowl while serving.
        </li>
        <li>You can accentuate the taste of this recipe by adding one tablespoon of almond paste, which you can prepare with soaked almonds. This will make the dal creamier.</li>
    </ul>
